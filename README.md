PippoQuickstart

It will work like [composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) using composer.phar.

The developer shall download "Pippo-cli.jar" and execute ```java -jar Pippo-cli.jar init```.

Pippo-cli will read ````PippoFile.json```, will clone a [dummy project](https://github.com/MateusGabi/Example-Pippo-WebApp-) and will re-write a pom.xml 

Can you help me?
